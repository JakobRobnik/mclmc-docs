# Applications

## Test problems

There is a variety of standard problems which are useful for testing the speed and correctness of an inference algorithm.

## Molecular Dynamics

Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a computational method for investigating the (classical) behavior of physical systems, which uses a numerical integrator and an (approximate) potential function to simulate the Hamiltonian dynamics of a molecular system, usually over a sufficient time period in order that equilibrium is reached.

However, if equilibrium thermodynamic information is the goal, the dynamics need not follow the true Hamiltonian, and MCLMC may be much faster.

We apply MD to two standard systems:

2. Silicon Crystal: [notebook]()
