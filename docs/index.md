# Microcanonical Monte Carlo

[Microcanonical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo]() (MCHMC) and its generalization [Microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo]() (MCLMC) constitute a new sampling algorithm for problems with differentiable potentials.

This page exists as a supplement to the papers, in order to explain [the theory behind the algorithm](/docs/tutorial.md), and document [a variety of applications](/docs/applications.md) to which it can be applied.
