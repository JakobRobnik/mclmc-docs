# Microcanonical Monte Carlo

[Microcanonical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo]() (MCHMC) and its generalization [Microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo]() (MCLMC) constitute a new sampling algorithm for problems with differentiable potentials.

This website exists as a supplement to those papers, in order to explain [the theory behind the algorithm](tutorial.md) in more detail, and document [a variety of applications](applications.md) to which it can be applied.
